> Fundamental data is quarterly/annual (P/E, EPS, ROE, etc.). Required for fundamental strategy nodes.
> Source: yfinance `ticker.financials`, `ticker.balance_sheet`, `ticker.quarterly_earnings`.
> Point-in-time approximation: use period end date + 45 days (typical SEC 10-Q filing window) to avoid look-ahead bias.

---

## v1 — Graph Interpreter

**Goal:** Every node in the visual builder executes real logic, not just `OnBar → Buy`.
**Approach:** A `GraphStrategy` class that topologically sorts the graph and evaluates each node per bar.
Replaces the current `_strategy_from_graph` DCA-only fallback in `background/tasks/backtest.py`.

### Step 1 — Topological sort
- [x] Parse graph nodes + edges into a dependency map
- [x] Kahn's algorithm produces stable evaluation order
- [x] Cycle detection — unreachable nodes logged as warning

### Step 2 — Node evaluators (current)
- [x] `OnBar` — emits `MarketDataPayload`
- [x] `Data` — outputs close price from bar
- [x] `SMA(period)` — rolling mean; suppressed during warm-up
- [x] `EMA(period)` — seeded with SMA, then exponential update; suppressed during warm-up
- [x] `RSI(period)` — Wilder RSI 0–100; suppressed during warm-up
- [x] `IfAbove(A, B)` — routes `true`/`false` based on A > B; coerces payload inputs to float
- [x] `Buy(amount)` — emits `AddSignal` when triggered
- [x] `Sell` — emits `CloseSignal` when triggered

### Step 3 — State management
- [x] Per-node rolling price buffer (deque)
- [x] EMA value persists across bars
- [x] `reset()` clears all state between runs

### Step 4 — Multi-input nodes
- [x] `IfAbove` resolves `a`/`b` inputs by `targetHandle` on edges
- [x] `_to_float` coerces MarketDataPayload inputs to price float

### Step 5 — Wire into backtest task
- [x] `_strategy_from_graph` now returns `GraphStrategy` (falls back to DCA for empty graph)

### Step 6 — Frontend validation
- [x] `IfAbove` `a`/`b` ports: already required by node spec — existing loop catches missing connections
- [x] RSI period validation added (was only SMA/EMA before)
- [x] Warm-up period estimate shown below date inputs when indicator nodes are present

### Step 7 — Tests
- [x] 46 unit tests: topo-sort, SMA/EMA/RSI evaluators, IfAbove, Buy, Sell, position guard, reset, fallback
- [ ] Integration test: full run with SMA crossover graph produces trades at correct bars

---

## v1 — Node Library Expansion (Technical Indicators)

**Goal:** Cover all common technical analysis strategies traders use in practice.

### Critical — unlocks most standard strategies
- [x] `IfBelow(A, B)` — routes `true`/`false` based on A < B (mirror of IfAbove). Required for RSI oversold, price below BB lower band, etc.
- [x] `IfCrossAbove(A, B)` — fires `true` on the bar where A crosses above B (was below previous bar). Required for all MA crossover and MACD crossover strategies.
- [x] `IfCrossBelow(A, B)` — fires `true` on the bar where A crosses below B. Required for death cross, overbought exits.
- [x] `Constant(value)` — outputs a user-defined fixed number. Required for comparisons like RSI < 30, price > 200.

### High — most commonly used indicators
- [ ] `MACD(fast, slow, signal)` — outputs `macd` line, `signal` line, `histogram`. Most popular trend-following indicator.
- [ ] `BollingerBands(period, std)` — outputs `upper`, `middle`, `lower` bands. Used for mean reversion and breakout strategies.
- [ ] `ATR(period)` — Average True Range; outputs volatility scalar. Used for position sizing and stop-loss placement.
- [ ] `Volume` — outputs raw bar volume. Required for volume confirmation strategies.

### Medium — broader coverage
- [ ] `Stochastic(k_period, d_period)` — outputs `%K` and `%D`. Used for overbought/oversold in trending markets.
- [ ] `VWAP` — Volume Weighted Average Price; outputs intraday mean price. Common institutional benchmark.
- [ ] `VWAP(period)` — Rolling Volume-Weighted Average Price over N daily bars. Institutional benchmark for entry/exit levels.
- [ ] `MFI(period)` — Money Flow Index; combines price + volume into 0–100 oscillator. Volume-aware overbought/oversold.
- [ ] `ADX(period)` — Average Directional Index; outputs trend strength 0–100. Used to filter ranging vs trending markets.
- [ ] `OBV` — On-Balance Volume; cumulative volume flow. Used to confirm price trend with volume.
- [ ] `CCI(period)` — Commodity Channel Index; outputs oscillator. Used for overbought/oversold and divergence.
- [ ] `WilliamsR(period)` — Williams %R; outputs −100–0 oscillator. Similar use to Stochastic.

### Logic / utility nodes
- [ ] `And(A, B)` — outputs `true` only if both A and B are true. Required to combine multiple conditions.
- [ ] `Or(A, B)` — outputs `true` if either A or B is true.
- [ ] `Not(A)` — inverts a boolean signal.

### For each new node
- [ ] Backend: add evaluator branch in `GraphStrategy.on_event`
- [ ] Backend: add unit tests in `test_graph_strategy.py`
- [ ] Frontend: add node spec to palette (type, ports, params, inspector fields)
- [ ] Frontend: add warm-up period to estimate where applicable (MACD = slow period, BB = period, ATR = period)

**Strategies unlocked by this expansion:**
| Strategy | Nodes required |
|---|---|
| MA crossover (golden/death cross) | SMA × 2 + IfCrossAbove/Below → Buy/Sell |
| RSI oversold/overbought | RSI + Constant(30) + IfBelow → Buy; Constant(70) + IfAbove → Sell |
| MACD crossover | MACD + IfCrossAbove(macd, signal) → Buy |
| Bollinger Band mean reversion | BollingerBands + IfBelow(price, lower) → Buy; IfAbove(price, upper) → Sell |
| Bollinger Band breakout | BollingerBands + IfCrossAbove(price, upper) → Buy |
| RSI + MA trend filter | SMA + IfAbove(price, SMA) + RSI + IfBelow(RSI, 50) + And → Buy |
| Volume surge breakout | Volume + SMA(volume) + IfCrossAbove(vol, vol_sma) + IfAbove(price, SMA) + And → Buy |
| Stochastic crossover | Stochastic + IfCrossAbove(%K, %D) + IfBelow(%K, Constant(20)) + And → Buy |

## v2 — Fundamental Strategy Nodes

> Requires `FundamentalSnapshot` DB table and fundamental data pipeline (see Market Data above).
> Data is forward-filled between quarterly reporting dates using point-in-time available_from date to avoid look-ahead bias.

- [ ] `PB` — outputs price-to-book ratio
- [ ] `EPS` — outputs trailing twelve-month EPS
- [ ] `EPSGrowth` — outputs YoY EPS growth rate (%)
- [ ] `RevenueGrowth` — outputs YoY revenue growth rate (%)
- [ ] `DividendYield` — outputs annual dividend yield (%)

**Fundamental strategies enabled:**
| Strategy | Nodes required |
|---|---|
| Value screen — low P/E + high dividend | PE + Constant(15) + IfBelow + DividendYield + Constant(3) + IfAbove + And → Buy |
| Growth screen — high EPS growth | EPSGrowth + Constant(20) + IfAbove → Buy |
| Quality filter — high ROE + low debt | ROE + Constant(15) + IfAbove + DebtEquity + Constant(1) + IfBelow + And → Buy |
| PEG undervalued | PEG + Constant(1) + IfBelow → Buy |
| Dogs of the Dow | DividendYield (rank by universe — requires batch mode) |

---

## v1 — pandas_ta Precompute Refactor

> Current: GraphStrategy computes SMA/EMA/RSI per-bar via rolling buffers (works but doesn't scale to 130+ nodes).
> Target: precompute all indicator series upfront as a DataFrame before the backtest loop; on_event becomes O(1) dict lookup.
> Benefit: vectorized, no warm-up state management, all pandas_ta indicators available with one line each.

- [ ] Pass full OHLCV DataFrame into `GraphStrategy.__init__`
- [ ] On init: scan graph nodes, call `df.ta.<indicator>()` for each used indicator
- [ ] Store results in `self._precomputed: dict[node_id, pd.Series]`
- [ ] `on_event`: index into series by bar timestamp instead of computing per-bar
- [ ] Remove `_price_buffers`, `_ema_values`, `_rsi_state` (replaced by precomputed series)
- [ ] Update `backtest.py` Celery task to build DataFrame before constructing `GraphStrategy`
- [ ] Update all unit tests to pass DataFrame

---

## v1 — Equity Curve
